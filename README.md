# VRHackathon2016
Seattle VR Hackathon
During our Hackathon session we decided to use Alexa as your personal servant while in VR

The story followed the Southpark episode where Cartmen is in WOW and has his mom take care of all his needs.

Cartmen is in VR and wants a to text Kenny to have him join in VR

We used the echo via Apps and Services/Alexa skills wrapped into a node.js function via amazons AWS Lamda. The function would make a call to twilio,which is scripted to make a telephone call and a text message get sent.
